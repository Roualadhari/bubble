# Sorting Algorithms Comparison

This project implements and compares two basic sorting algorithms: **Bubble Sort** and **Selection Sort**, along with Python's built-in sorting function for performance benchmarking.

## Overview

The code:
- Implements Bubble Sort and Selection Sort algorithms
- Tests their performance on small (50 elements) and large (1000 elements) datasets
- Measures and displays execution time for each algorithm
- Compares results with Python's built-in `sorted()` function

## Features

- **Bubble Sort**: Simple comparison-based sorting with O(n²) time complexity
- **Selection Sort**: Minimum-finding sort with O(n²) time complexity
- **Performance Testing**: Random datasets generated for consistent comparison
- **Time Measurement**: Precise execution time tracking using `time` module

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external dependencies needed

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Run the script:
```bash
python sorting_comparison.py
